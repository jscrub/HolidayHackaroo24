Welcome! This is the start of a Holiday 2024 repo for notes, collaborations, scripts, writeups, etc for the ongoing challenges. If you are a collaborader, PLEASE be careful not to violate terms and conditions. It is alright to share hints and notes, but writeups (such as those for Holiday Hack Challenges) cannot be released until they are ready. Recommend holding on full writeups until after and only post helpful commands, references, and guides on tools or methodology.


If you wish to collaborate, please let me know. The folders will separate the challenges.
