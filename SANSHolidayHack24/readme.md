Holiday Hack Challenge 2024: Snow-maggedon
Whether you're a first-time player or a seasoned participant, this year’s Holiday Hack brings exciting new features you won’t want to miss! We’ve introduced a new dynamic for this year: challenges will be gradually released* in sync with the story, keeping the experience fresh and immersive. See challenges release dates and new features included.

November 7........Prologue
November 11......Act 1
November 18......Act 2
December 2........Act 3
Skill Levels: Every challenge will offer two modes: an easy mode and a harder mode. Players can choose either mode to solve the challenge, depending on their skill level or preference.

Challenge Skipping: Each challenge will include a “play-through” mode, allowing players to advance the storyline without solving the challenge immediately. You can skip a challenge and return to it later.

Share Solutions: For the Prologue, Act 1, and Act 2, participants can post answers or livestream their solutions starting one week after each section's release. This allows others to learn from shared solutions and progress in the game. However, for Act 3, players must wait until after the competition ends before sharing their answers or solutions.
